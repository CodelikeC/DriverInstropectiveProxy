# DriverInstropectiveProxy

**DriverInstropectiveProxy** is an experimental project that explores the integration of AI into the kernel/driver space—where introspection, real-time responsiveness, and low-level security are critical.

## 🚀 Purpose

To build a smart proxy operating at the driver level, capable of:
- Monitoring system behavior in real time
- Reacting or alerting upon anomalies
- Communicating with AI modules to make context-aware decisions

## 🔍 Why "Instropective"?

Because this proxy doesn’t just relay data—it **observes**, **analyzes**, and **responds**. It acts as a conscious intermediary, making the system more adaptive and secure.

## 🧠 AI Integration

- Lightweight AI models designed for constrained environments
- Supports local inference or IPC with external AI daemons
- Extensible to connect with systems like Safe AI or IBCS

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- OS with driver-level hook support (Linux kernel module, Windows WDM/UMDF)
- Compiler: GCC/Clang or MSVC
- Python (optional, for AI daemon support)
