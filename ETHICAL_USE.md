# Ethical Use Statement for DIP
Although this software is released under the permissive Apache-2.0 License to encourage open innovation and collaboration, the authors strongly discourage its use in any context that violates the principles of ethical, human-centered Artificial Intelligence.

Specifically, we oppose the use of this software in:

Military applications, including autonomous weapons, target identification, or combat decision-making.
Mass surveillance systems, behavioral profiling at scale, or systems that infringe on individual privacy.
Oppressive regimes, authoritarian tools, or platforms used for censorship, control, or digital repression.
Commercial systems that exploit users unfairly, extract data without consent, or manipulate behavior.
By using this software, you are encouraged to:

Respect user rights and privacy.
Use AI responsibly and transparently.
Consider the social, psychological, and political consequences of your deployment.
This statement is non-binding, but reflects the spirit of the authors and the intended direction of this project.

Let us build a project that empowers — not controls — humanity.
